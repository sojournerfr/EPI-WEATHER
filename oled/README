# OLED Weather Station

This project demonstrates the use of an OLED display with an ESP32 or Arduino-compatible board. The display is initialized and used to show a simple "Hello, world!" message.

## Features
- Utilizes the Adafruit SSD1306 library for OLED display control.
- Displays text on a 128x64 OLED screen.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following:

1. **Hardware**:
   - A 128x64 OLED display.
   - An ESP32 or Arduino-compatible board.
   - Jumper wires for connections.

2. **Software**:
   - [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) installed on your system.
   - The following libraries installed via PlatformIO:
     - `Adafruit GFX Library`
     - `Adafruit SSD1306`

## Setup

1. Connect the OLED display to your board:
   - **SDA** to the board's **SDA** pin.
   - **SCL** to the board's **SCL** pin.
   - **VCC** to the board's **3.3V** or **5V** pin.
   - **GND** to the board's **GND** pin.

2. Clone this repository or copy the project files to your local machine.

3. Open the project in PlatformIO.

4. Build and upload the code to your board.

## Code Overview

The main code is located in `src/main.cpp` and performs the following tasks:

- Initializes the OLED display.
- Displays a "Hello, world!" message on the screen.

## Usage

1. Power on your board.
2. The OLED display should initialize and show the message "Hello, world!".

## Troubleshooting

- If the display does not initialize, ensure the I2C address (default: `0x3C`) matches your OLED display's address.
- Check all hardware connections.
