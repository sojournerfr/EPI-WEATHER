In this current directory ('website'), you can find my index.php page that load the Arduino's values
This file call a python script under the script folder, which one read the flew values from the Arduino and return them.
So, if you want to use it notice that you must find on wich wire do you plug your Arduino, and change the script.py file to the correct one.
